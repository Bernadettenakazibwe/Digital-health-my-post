# **APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE HEALTH SECTOR**
(By: *Bernadette Nakazibwe*)

In the todayâ€™s world where the scientists are active day and night using their brain power to innovate new technologies in many fields of which health field is part. This has both positive and negative effects on the health sector, but according to the health workers, this has made provision of better and standard health services to the patient easy and faster. 

## **Medical Technologies**. 
Technology has been applied in many medical procedures on external human body, internal human body, manufacturing drugs and even during their administrations, during surgeries and many other procedures.
In the past years, there has been many technological advancements in the medical field where many devices have been innovated and even many procedures have been digitalized, and some of the devices include the following below.

### **1. Wearable devices**
These are devices that people wear to follow up their health situation and also exercise activities. These include the smart watches like the Apple smartwatch, and these are one of the most important things that has helped many people to live longer and even reduce the high numbers of patients in the hospital waiting for health workers advice, because the patients themselves can monitor their own blood pressure, respiratory rate and even their oxygen levels, hence no need of waiting for medical assistance for such procedures.

### **2.Imaging Machinery**.
 These include the Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI), Computer Tomography(CT) scans, PET Scans, X- Rays. All of these and some others. They are used to observe the human internal body in oder to give the right medication to the patients and also they have assisted doctors during invasive surgeries. Forexample they can be used when observing tumours, broken bones and other conditions like the cardiovascular, respiratory digestive.
 
 Some the other digital devices include the Digital Diagnostic ECG System, Digital Ultrasound Prob Digital Medical Camera, Digital Stetoscope, Dental Camera, Ventilators, Anaesthesia devices.

## **Impacts of applying technology in the health field**.

[Digital health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_health#:~:text=Digital%20health%2C%20which%20includes%20digital%20care%20programs%2C%20is,delivery%20to%20make%20medicine%20more%20personalized%20and%20precise.) has greatly improved the health sector in some of the ways as staed below.

- **Reduction of errors as a result of medical records**. 

Medical records have reduced [Medical errors](https://blogs.iadb.org/salud/en/three-impacts-of-digital-health-on-healthcare/#:~:text=Impact%20%231%3A%20Digital%20health%20can%20make%20healthcare%20more,are%20far%20more%20fre) because the health workers depends use the recodrs to provide the right medication to each and every patient.Medical workers have used computers to store the medical records of their patients. This has enable to do full follow up on the diseases that most people suffer and find ways of treating such conditions. For instance, the [first case](https://www.livescience.com/first-case-coronavirus-found.html) of COVID-19 was recorded in China in December 2019. Other more cases were recorded from other countries, but to confirm the different cases in different countries the medical workers referred from the [signs and symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/covid/covid-19-symptoms) that the first COVID-19 infected person in China showed. Digital medical records help much in diagnosing different diseases depending on the signs showed by different patients, and also help in the medical research.

- **Provision of high quality health care to all parts of the world**.

This is done in various ways. Forexample, through [medical apps](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-medical-apps/) which have been used by the patients to discuss their conditions with their doctors, schedule appointments at different hospitals, order for medicine from different hospitals, determine the level of their exercises, feeding the children like breast feeding babies, and even the patients who might need to be given food in measurable conditions. 

Through medical apps, even patients in the remote areas can receive high quality healthcare.

**In conclusion**, digital health is still developing. As per the [World Health Global strategy](https://www.who.int/health-topics/digital-health/#tab=tab_3), digital health is to make the high quality health care easily accessible in high icome, middle income and even low income countries between the 2020 and 2025 so that all countries provide strong health services to their citizens.
